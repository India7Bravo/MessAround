# MessAround
Messing around with stuff - might just be a demo test

# How to run the tests

* Ensure that you have NPM installed on your machine.
* Ensure that you have Cypress installed on your machine.
* If you're running an M1 chip, please ensure Rosetta2 is installed on your machine.

If you do not have them installed, please install them from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ - https://www.cypress.io/ before running the tests

* Make sure to either clone or download a copy of the code
* Open the folder in your preferred IDE
* softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license (install Rosetta2)
* Run: "npx cypress open" in the built in terminal to open cypress

Once Cypress is open, click the button which reads "Run 'x' Integration tests".

I hope you enjoy the test :)
